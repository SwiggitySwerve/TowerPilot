"""Shard farming - the human session, replayed as a loop.

Recorded from the user on 2026-08-13
(recordings/main/20260813_111519_shard_farm, 31 gestures + 46 paired frames)
and narrated by them step by step.

The idea: on Tier 18 a FLEET spawns at WAVE 95 (then every 100 waves). Killing
it pays 1650 Reroll Shards 80% of the time, or 5 module shards of one random
type the other 20% - the official table, unchanged by the v28.3 fleet
rebalance. Everything after that kill is dead weight, so the run is abandoned
immediately and restarted. One loop is roughly two minutes, most of which is
the Intro Sprint racing to wave 100.

Wave 95 is why waiting until the end of wave 101 makes the kill unconditional:
the fleet has been on the field for six waves by then, and fleets spawn even
on waves the sprint skips. It also removes any need to tell the three fleet
types apart - whichever one rolled, it is already there and it drops the same.

    SETUP (once)   end any live run -> the block's tier -> the shard_farm
                   loadout (deck, presets, modules as configured) -> BATTLE
    LOOP (forever) wave 100 -> cancel Intro Sprint
                   -> wave 101 nearly over -> NUKE
                   -> side menu -> EXIT BATTLE -> Surrender -> RETRY

RETRY restarts the same tier with the same cards and modules, which is why the
setup only runs once - the recorded session does the whole card/module dance
before the first battle and never again.

Two triggers make this work, and both are read, never timed:
  * the WAVE COUNTER for 100 - the sprint is cancelled the moment it lands
  * the WAVE PROGRESS bar (rois.wave_progress) for "101 is nearly over" -
    a clean sawtooth that ramps 0 -> ~0.85 and resets, so "almost over" is a
    threshold on it rather than a stopwatch

Shares tourney.py's navigation helpers rather than duplicating them: the
find/wait_for/require/tap_at/ensure_home/end_round machinery was built and
debugged for the tournament routine and the screens are the same.
